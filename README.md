More and better documentation is coming soon!

Code for our paper on complex gated recurrent neural networks.

Use the montreal_eval.py file to recreate our experiments on the memory and adding problem.

For the human motion prediction experiemnts run: 

'''
cd human-motion-prediction
python src/translate.py --action walking --seq_length_out 25 --iterations 20000
