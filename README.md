## complex_net repository
The is the current private development repository for our Phase-Relu 
Complex Neural network project.

Current development happens in the cgmu/phase-filter-RNN folder.
cgmu/complex_RNN-montreal contains the code from the arjovski paper.
cgmu/uRNN-zurich contains the code from the Hyland paper.

A summary of the theory underpinning this work may be found in proposal/eigopt.pdf
